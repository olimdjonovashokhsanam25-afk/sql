 Module 1: SQL & Database Basics

 1. What is a Database? 
A database is an organized place to store information so you can find and change it easily. Think of it like a spreadsheet with many sheets (tables) where each sheet stores related information.

2. Key Terms (beginner-friendly)
- Table (FROM): A named sheet that holds rows and columns (e.g., a table named `shop`).
- Row / Record (SELECT): One single entry in a table (one sweet in the shop).
- Column / Field (WHERE): A property for every row (name, price, email).
- Primary Key (PK): A column that uniquely identifies each row (like an ID number).
- Foreign Key (FK): A column that links a row in one table to a row in another table.

Visual: a table with columns and rows

| id (PK) | name       | price |
|--------:|------------|------:|
| 1       | Chocolate  |  150  |   
| 2       | Candy      |   50  |

Diagram (simple):

students (id PK, name, email)
  |
  |-- student_id (FK) in `grades` links a student's grades

grades (id PK, student_id FK, subject, score)

 3. Main SQL Command Categories (very short)
- DDL (Structure): CREATE, ALTER, DROP — used to change the shape of tables.
- DML (Data): SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE — used to read and change table contents.
